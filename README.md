# SDK_Tutorials

In this repository we will centralize all different SDKs you can use with Applitools.

Each project has a base test as an example as well as a folder for you to put the cases you're working on in.
The cases folder will be .gitignored so feel free to add whatever you'd like to that folder without worry.
